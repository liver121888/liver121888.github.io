# **About**
Li-Wei's research interest lies in robotics and industrial automation, especially surgical robots. To integrate an automatic system, Li-Wei has been trained in various subjects including ML, Automatic Control, and Computer Vision, etc. Supervised by professor Yen and funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Li-Wei works on an undergraduate project regarding oral specimen collection robots, planning to create a patient-adapting oral model in high-fidelity simulation. Li-Wei actively takes on new challengesâ€”his vigor earned him a Dean's List Award while he took several upper-division as well as master-level courses. On the other hand, his learning passion motivates him to pursue the state-of-art technique by participating in Taoyuan ROS summer school 2021 and Nvidia GTC 2021. His interest in robotics sprouted from a LEGO EV3 set as a birthday present from his father.
